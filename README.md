Unravel your REPL

Unravel is a simple command-line client for Clojure REPLs. It is based on the [unrepl](https://github.com/cgrand/unrepl) protocol.

## Status

Work in progress

## Usage

Open a Clojure socket server. (For testing you can use `scripts/server`, which starts a socket server on port 50505.)

In another terminal, run

```
scripts/run localhost <socket-server-port>
```
